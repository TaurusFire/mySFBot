The code in this repo is mostly based on the Street Fighter II tutorial by Nicholas Renotte on Youtube (repo at https://github.com/nicknochnack/StreetFighterRL/tree/main).

The code for the discretizer (used for the DQN model) was taken from OpenAI at: https://github.com/openai/retro/blob/master/retro/examples/discretizer.py


Version Dependencies:
Setting up a virtual environment with these versions is highly recommended, since at the time of creation, the current module versions do not work together.

Python 3.8 
pip 19.1
Gym 0.21.0
Gym-retro 0.8.0
Setuptools 65.5
Stable-baselines3 1.7.0
Opencv-python 4.8.0.76
Optuna 3.3.0

Roms should be in a separate folder. 
Use the terminal to navigate to the ROM folder and import using "python -m retro.import ."
Should receive message saying "Imported x games"

To run the bot in your virtual environment, use the Test versions of the files (e.g. A2C_SFBotTest). Ensure that the relevant bots are also downloaded on your machine. For example, for the A2C_SFBotTest file, test either of the A2C_1000000, A2C_5000000 or A2CNR_5000000 bots.
